Winnovative Software License Agreement 
======================================

General 
-------

The copyright in this software ("the Software") is owned by No Limit Software ("the Owner"). This is a license agreement between "the Owner" and "You". 
You may not load the Software into any computer or copy it without the licence of the Owner. The Owner offers you a non-exclusive licence on the terms 
of this Agreement. 

You are permitted to load the Software and use it only on a computer which is under the control of your company, unless a redistributable licence has 
been purchased in which case the software may be used on any computer inside or outside your company as part of your own products. 

You are not permitted: 

a) to rent, lease, sub-licence, loan, copy (except as expressly provided in this Agreement), modify, adapt, merge, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, 
disassemble, create derivative works, create wrappers or general purpose online services duplicating a whole or a part of the development library functionality 
based on the whole or any part of the Software or its associated documentation or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Software. 

b) to distribute any part of the Software as part of any software development system without the Owners express written permission.

c) except as expressly provided in this Agreement, to use, reproduce or deal in the Software in any way. 

d) create commercial or for personal use derivative products competing with the Software without the Owner express written permission. If you are not sure 
if a product is in competition with the Owner products you must contact the Owner for clarifications. 

License types 

1) Deployment License 

A "Deployment License" can be used in a single application that can be deployed on a single server owned by your company. The deployment license cannot be 
redistributed which means you cannot use a deployment license in an application that you distribute to your own customers. The deployment license includes software 
updates and standard technical support in the first year from purchase date. The deployment license cannot be used in personal or commercial products competing 
with our products without our written permission. 

2) Redistributable License 

A "Redistributable License"can be used by an unlimited number of developers, in an unlimited number of applications that can be deployed on any number of computers. 
The redistributable license can be included in your own applications that you distribute to your own customers without any additional costs. The protection of the 
license key from being illegally used by your customers in their own applications is your responsibility. The redistributable license includes software updates and 
priority technical support in the first year from purchase date. The redistributable license cannot be used in personal or commercial products competing with our 
products without our written permission. 

3) Demo License 

A "Demo License" can be used only to evaluate the Software in order to make sure it fully meets your requirements. It cannot be used in personal or commercial products.
